# Object Oriented Programming : Boids

The project is dedicated to the study of the properties of multi-agent systems.

The first part consisted in developing a simulator of balls which move in a window, and which bounce on the
a window, and which bounce on the edges.

The second part consisted in developing two games of cellular automata: the game of
Conway's life and the immigration game. Afterwards we realized a slightly different model
of cellular automaton slightly different, but wanting to be more realistic which is the model of segregation of Schelling which aims at simulating the phenomenon of
segregation within a population.

The third part presents a model of swarms: the boids. The objective this time is to
to add interaction between cellular agents.

# Code

The source code of the final project is not publicly available because this project will be proposed again next year at ENSIMAG.
